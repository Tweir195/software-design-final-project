##### Context
Our project is an educational animation for 4th graders about the environment.  Our plan is to include approx. 5 environmental locations and educate the user about them.  Right now in the development stage, we have created an architecture for backgrounds, information, and pictures to go together for one location.  We have done some animation work to get a character bobbing up and down in the ocean.  We are looking for ways to move between locations easily and additional features to further engage the users.
##### Questions/Feedback
*Having one big while loop in main.py and using indexs or having seprate while loops
*How do we stop images and buttons from blinking when we blit larger images
* How should we have the user navigate through backgrounds, should they be pre-ordered in a list ? How to we include user flexibility ?
* What other things can we do with the main character animation ? What other parts of the program could be animated
* Is digitally drawing each background worth it ?  What are other ways we can keep a cohesive aesthetic ?
* Any ideas for ways to keep the users (4th graders engaged), structural, aesthetic, or information related ?
* Is there anything that would make the experience better for 4th graders using our program, what would you want to see if you were in elementary school ?
