###The Big Idea: 
To create an education animation for children about the environment
-Topics to explore: Animation, Graphics, interactive programming
-MVP: An animation of the character going to different locations that each have facts about the environment, starting with 5 locations, and then putting the game on a website.
-Stretch: Make the character animation more of a choose your own story where there are multiple paths that the character will follow with more paths and more user involvement.  
###Learning Goals:
-Tommy: I want to learn more about making animations in python, and also improve on my understanding of git.
-Abby: Get better at scaffolding the code in a valuable way and gain a solid understanding of animation in python
-Andrew: I want to be able to understand all of our code and understand what each function does.
-Emily: I want to learn how structure code in an organized and efficient manner.
###Implementation Plan:
-Pygame, Bokeh, D3 are all potential libraries
###Project Schedule:
-Week 1-research facts, seek out animation help, decide on libraries to use, 
-Week 2- graphics development and game structure start basic animation of boat
-Week 3-backgrounds and complete animation for 2 of the locations
-Week 4-Finish animation for all locations and decide what other elements we think we can fit in the project
-Week 5-Tie all locations together to make a functional interactive game
-Week 6-Finish up remaining tasks and add to a website
###Collaboration plan:
-Always meet in pairs to do pair programming but not necessarily always work as a whole group
###Risks:
-Lack of background with the libraries we are using
-Getting caught up in the details and not focusing on the bigger picture of completing a functional project
-Conflicts between different libraries 
###Additional Course Content:
-Animation
-Better ways to scaffold a project (how to be more intentional in your scaffolding)
