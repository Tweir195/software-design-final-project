## Reflection and Synthesis
### Feedback and Decisions
* We are going to use pygame as our main library
Feedback: 
* Make sure to use 4th grade level language when discussing the envirometnal issues so that they understand.
* Adding sound would distract the users from thinking about the educational part and keep kid engaged
* Everyone suggested using pygame as the libreary due to the amount of documentation and support for peers/ninja's
* animating the world map will be pretty challenging
Decisions: 
* Use pygame
* have background music
* instead of dping the map, have the scenes use buttons to transition between
### Stretch Goals
* specifc sounds effects for click on certain things in a scene
* having the player be able to add their own name 
* go back button
* Nice website
