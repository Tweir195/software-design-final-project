## Reflection and Synthesis from the Second Architectural Review
### Feedback and Decisions
* We should try to use pygame sprites instead of making our own sprite class to help with the blinking issues
* It would be more interactive to the user if we had cues in the background to click on to learn smaller facts.
* We shouldn't use only spacebar or only cursor to navigate through our animation
* Background music would make our animation more engaging
### Review Process Reflection
* We didn't get any feedback on an alternative to making all of the backgrounds ourselves, so we will continue to draw the backgrounds that we need
* It would have been helpful if we had a more developed MVP to show during our review, so we should spend more focused time working
