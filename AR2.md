## Architectural Review 2
##### Agenda
##### Context
Our project is an educational animation for 4th graders about the enviroment.  Our plan is to include approx. 5 enviromental locations and educate the user about them.  Right now in the development stage, we have create an architecture for backgrounds, information, and pictures to go togther for one location  We are looking for ways to move between locations easily and potentailly add flexiblity for the user to chose where they want to go.
##### Questions
* How should we have the user naviage through backgrounds, should they be pre-ordered in a list ? How to we include user flexability ?
* Is digitally drawing each background worth it ?  What are other ways we can keep a cohesive aesthetic ?
* Any ideas for ways to keep the users (4th graders engaged), strucutural, aestethic, or infomration relaated ?
* Is there anything that would make the experience better for 4th graders using our program ?
